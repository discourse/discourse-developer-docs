For those looking to add custom languages and translations to a Discourse theme or theme component, they [can now include](
https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/880311dd4d2b367e54cc8244fba60fce69e121c3) localised strings, which are made available for use in UI components. Translations are stored in the same format as core/plugin translations, and can be used in almost the same way. 

Themes can supply translation files in a format like `/locales/{locale}.yml`. These files should be valid YAML, with a single top level key equal to the locale being defined. These can be defined using the `discourse_theme` CLI, importing a `.tar.gz`, installing from a GIT repository, or via the editor on theme-creator.discourse.org.

An example locale file might look like

```
en: 
  theme_metadata: 
    description: "This is a description for my theme"
    settings:
      theme_setting_name: "This is a description for the setting `theme_setting_name`"
      another_theme_setting_name:
        description: "This is a description for the setting `another_theme_setting_name`"
  sidebar: 
    welcome: "Welcome"
    back: "back,"
    welcome_subhead: "We're glad you're here!"
    likes_header: "Share the Love"
    badges_header: "Your Top Badges"
    full_profile: "View your full profile"
```

Administrators can override individual keys on a per-theme basis in the /admin/customize/themes user interface. Fallback is handled in the same way as core, so it is ok to have incomplete translations for non-english languages will make use of the english keys.

In the background, these translations are stored alongside the core translations, under a theme-specific namespace. For example:
```
theme_translation.{theme_id}.sidebar.welcome
```
You should never hardcode the theme_id in your theme code, so there are a few ways to help you access the translations.

In `.hbs` files, you can use the dedicated helper
```hbs
{{theme-i18n "my_translation_key"}}
```

Or, if you need to pass the translation key into another component, you can use the `theme-prefix` helper:

```hbs
<DButton @label={{theme-prefix "my_translation_key"}} />
```

In Javascript, or in `.gjs` files, you can use the themePrefix function. This is automatically injected, and does not need to be imported:

```gjs
const result = I18n.t(themePrefix("my_translation_key"))

<template>
  {{i18n (themePrefix "blah")}}
</template>
```
