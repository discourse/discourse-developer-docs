Themes and theme components allow you to handle uploaded assets such as images and fonts. You can control what assets your theme accepts using the site setting: `theme authorized extensions`

## Including assets in themes and components

### For remote themes

Remote themes include:

- Themes and components installed from the <kbd>Popular</kbd> list of themes
- Themes and components installed using the <kbd>From a git repository</kbd> method

To upload assets to a remote theme or theme component, see https://meta.discourse.org/t/create-and-share-a-font-theme-component/62462 for a detailed example.

### Uploading assets to local themes and components

Local themes include:

- The default Light and Dark themes that ship with every Discourse instance
- Themes and components created using the <kbd>+ Create New</kbd> installation method
- Themes and components that were uploaded from your local computer using the <kbd>From your device</kbd> installation method.

To upload assets to a local theme or theme component, navigate to your theme or component and select <kbd>+ Add</kbd> in the Uploads section:

![uploads|690x143,50%](/assets/include-assets-1.png)

In the Add Upload modal, choose a file and enter a SCSS variable name to use with with your CSS, javascript, and/or handlbars customizations

![upload-modal|683x500,40%](/assets/include-assets-2.png) 

Once uploaded, the asset will pop up in the Uploads list:

![uploaded-font|556x230,50%](/assets/include-assets-3.png) 

> :warning: **Important Note**: *Do not add uploads to themes and components through the admin interface if the component was installed remotely from a git repository. Updates to the component will clear out any uploads that were not included in the git repository.*

## How to make use of the assets

### SCSS

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: Amazing;
  src: url($Comic-Sans) format('woff2')
}

body {
    font-family: Amazing;
    font-size: 15px;
} 

.d-header {
    background-image: url($texture);
}
```

> :information_source: *When using `ttf` or `otf` fonts, be sure to use a format of `opentype`.*

### Javascript
```
<script type="text/discourse-plugin" version="0.8">
   console.log(settings.theme_uploads.balloons)
</script>
```

### Handlebars
```
<script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="/connectors/topic-above-post-stream/foobar">
  <img src="{{theme-setting "theme_uploads.balloons"}}">
</script>
```

### HTML
You can't directly add a theme asset to vanilla HTML (like in the header or after header sections of the customize admin panel). You have to use a handlebars template or the plugin API (more about those in https://meta.discourse.org/t/developer-s-guide-to-discourse-themes/93648). 

One workaround is to load your asset as a background image using SCSS (like the example above). So in the header section of your theme you might add:

```xml
<div class="my-custom-div">
  <a href="/"></a>
</div>
```

and then in your CSS:

```css
.my-custom-div a {
    height: 50px;
    width: 100px; 
    background-image: url($asset-name);
}
```

### Accessing theme uploads as settings

You may also treat `theme_uploads` as settings in JavaScript ([related commit](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/719a93c312b9caa6c71de22d67f1ce1a78c1c8b2)).

This allows themes and components access to theme assets.

Inside theme js you can now get the URL for an asset with:

```
settings.theme_uploads.name
```

And then you can do:

```
handlebars: {{theme-setting "theme_uploads.balloons"}}

javascript: settings.theme_uploads.balloons
```
