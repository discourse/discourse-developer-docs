As themes become more ambitious, we've been looking for ways to allow them to manipulate core **server-side** behaviour. While they will never be given the same level as control as plugins, we can provide some predefined hooks for themes to manipulate.

Introducing: theme modifiers :partying_face: 

They are specified using the `modifiers` key in your theme's `about.json` file.

For a 100% up-to-date list of modifiers, check the database schema at the bottom of [`theme_modifier_set.rb`](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/app/models/theme_modifier_set.rb), but here's a quick summary of what we have so far: 

- `serialize_topic_excerpts` **boolean** (default false) - always include excerpts when serializing  topic lists

- `csp_extensions` **string array** - add directives to the CSP. Works the same as the old "extend_content_security_policy" theme-setting method. But remember, [simple `<script> src="">` tags are allowed automatically](https://meta.discourse.org/t/automatically-adding-theme-scripts-to-csp/149028?u=david).

- `svg_icons` **string array** - a list of icons which should be included in the icon subset

- `topic thumbnails` **array of dimensions** - request additional resolutions in the topic thumbnail set. Note that they are generated asynchronously, so you must fall-back to the original image if your requested size is not provided. More information available [in the commit message](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/03818e642a1ae871bffdc0c39c10f05f0b8b0398)

One theme making heavy use of these new hooks is https://meta.discourse.org/t/topic-list-thumbnails-theme-component/150602?u=david - check out the code to see how it works.
