#### Theme settings

I won't be covering theme settings in the guide since we already have a very good guide detailing how to use them in your themes.

https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-to-add-settings-to-your-discourse-theme/82557

#### Theme translations

The theme translations system makes sure your theme is ready for a global audience. You can supply text in multiple languages, and Discourse will automatically substitute it in the right place, depending on the users' selected language. For more information, see

https://meta.discourse.org/t/adding-localizable-strings-to-themes-and-theme-components/109867

### Best practices

Now that you are familiar with Discourse theme basics, let's move on to a few recommendations that will make your life as a Discourse theme developer a lot easier.

##### Use Prettier

Prettier is a code formatting tool. The files on the Discourse repository are Prettified for consistent code formatting. It makes your code easier to read and...wait for it....pretty!

You can read more about Prettier here:

##### How to ask for help

If you're stuck on something that relates to themes, feel free to create a post in the #dev category. Be sure to include as much information as you can and anything you've tried. The more effort you put into your question, the more likely you'll get an answer.

You'll get extra attention if you make it clear that the help you need is for a theme you intend to release here on Meta.

##### Include a license

Including a license with your theme makes it clear that it's intended to be shared. I recommend the MIT license or equivalent for open source themes.

##### Creating a topic for your theme on Meta

If you'd like to share your theme here on Meta, please consider including the following if applicable

1. Short description at the top
2. Screenshots
3. Preview on theme creator
4. Instructions for theme settings
5. Link to theme installation guide

While we covered a lot of subjects, this guide barely scratches the surface and there's obviously things I may have missed.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

This guide is a wiki, if you have any improvements, please go ahead and make them by editing the topic.
