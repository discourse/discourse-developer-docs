This tutorial has been a whistle-stop tour through the process of creating a Discourse theme and experimenting with a few of the most common APIs. Of course, there's plenty more to learn, so let's map out some more places for you to explore.

## Existing themes & theme component

One of the best resources when learning about theme development is to read through the code of existing themes. Check out the directories in #theme and #theme-component, or jump straight to our [all-the-themes](http://github.com/discourse/all-the-themes) meta-repository for even more example code!

## Sharing your themes

Once you have a theme or theme component you're happy with, and it's published on GitHub, it's time to share it! Make a new topic in #theme or #theme-component and we'll review/publish it.

## How to ask for help

If you're stuck on something that relates to themes, feel free to create a post in the #dev category. Be sure to include as much information as you can and anything you've tried. The more effort you put into your question, the more likely you'll get an answer. If you can include code snippets, or link out to a repository on GitHub, that would be great!
