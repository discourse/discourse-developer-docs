So you want to set up Discourse on Ubuntu or Debian to hack on and develop with?

We'll assume that you work locally and don't have Ruby/Rails/Postgres/Redis installed on your Ubuntu or Debian system. Let's begin!

## Requirements

We suggest having at least 4 GB RAM and 2 CPU cores.

### Current compatibility:

| OS                           | Compatibility |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| Debian 11                    | ✅            |
| Crostini (Linux on ChromeOS) | ✅            |
| Ubuntu 22.04 or later        | ✅            |

## Install Discourse Dependencies

You will need the following packages on your system:

- [Git][git_link]
- [rbenv][rbenv_link] or [asdf][asdf_link]
- [ruby-build][ruby_build_link]
- [Ruby][ruby_link] (latest stable)
- [Rails][rails_link]
- [PostgreSQL][pg_link]
- [SQLite][sqlite_link]
- [Redis][redis_link]
- [Node.js][node_link]
- [pnpm][pnpm_link]
- [MailHog][mh_link]
- [ImageMagick][imagemagick_link]

Now that we have installed Discourse dependencies, let's move on to install Discourse itself.

## Clone Discourse

Clone the Discourse repository in `~/discourse` folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse.git ~/discourse
```

_`~` indicates home folder, so Discourse source code will be available in your home folder._

## Setup Database

Create role **with the same name as your Linux system username**:

```sh
cd /tmp && sudo -u postgres createuser -s "$USER"
```

[/details]

## Bootstrap Discourse

Switch to your Discourse folder:

```sh
 cd ~/discourse
```

Install the needed gems

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
bundle install
```

Install the JS dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

Now that you have successfully installed gems, run these commands:

```sh
bin/rails db:create
bin/rails db:migrate
RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails db:create db:migrate
```

Start rails and ember server:

```sh
bin/ember-cli -u
```

If the images are not appearing, use this command instead:
(_you can also specify an IP if you are working on a remote server_)

```sh
DISCOURSE_HOSTNAME=localhost UNICORN_LISTENER=localhost:3000 bin/ember-cli -u
```

You should now be able to navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see your local Discourse installation.

## Create New Admin

To create a new admin, run the following command:

```sh
bin/rails admin:create
```

Follow the prompts, and a new admin account will be created.

## Configure Mail

Run MailHog:

```sh
mailhog
```

Congratulations! You are now the admin of your own Discourse installation!

Happy hacking! And to get started with that, see [Beginner’s Guide to Creating Discourse Plugins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/beginners-guide-to-creating-discourse-plugins/30515).
