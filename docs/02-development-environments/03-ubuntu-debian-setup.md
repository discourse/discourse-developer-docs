So you want to set up Discourse on Ubuntu or Debian to hack on and develop with?

We'll assume that you work locally and don't have Ruby/Rails/Postgres/Redis installed on your Ubuntu or Debian system. Let's begin!

## Requirements
We suggest having at least 4 GB RAM and 2 CPU cores.

### Current compatibility:

|OS | Compatibility|
|--- | ---|
|Debian 11 | ✅|
|Crostini (Linux on ChromeOS)|✅|
|Ubuntu 22.04 or later | ✅|

## Install Discourse Dependencies

As regular user run [this script][linux_script] in terminal, to setup Rails development environment:-

```
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/discourse/install-rails/main/linux)
```

This will install the following new packages on your system:

* [Git][git_link]
* [rbenv][rbenv_link]
* [ruby-build][ruby_build_link]
* [Ruby][ruby_link] (stable)
* [Rails][rails_link]
* [PostgreSQL][pg_link]
* [SQLite][sqlite_link]
* [Redis][redis_link]
* [Bundler][bundler_link]
* [MailHog][mg]
* [ImageMagick][imagemagick_link]

*In case you have any of this package pre-installed and don't want to run the entire script, see the [script][linux_script] and pick the packages you don't have currently installed. The script is fine-tuned for Discourse, and includes all the packages required for Discourse installation.*

Now that we have installed Discourse dependencies, let's move on to install Discourse itself.

## Clone Discourse

Clone the Discourse repository in `~/discourse` folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/discourse/discourse.git ~/discourse
```

*`~` indicates home folder, so Discourse source code will be available in your home folder.*

## Setup Database

[details="Already completed by the install script"]
Create role **with the same name as your Linux system username**:

```
cd /tmp && sudo -u postgres createuser -s "$USER"
```
[/details]

## Bootstrap Discourse

Switch to your Discourse folder:

```
 cd ~/discourse
```
Install the needed gems

```
source ~/.bashrc
bundle install
```

Install the JS dependencies

```
yarn install
```

Now that you have successfully installed gems, run these commands:

```
bin/rails db:create 
bin/rails db:migrate
RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails db:create db:migrate
```

Start rails and ember server:

```
bin/ember-cli -u
```
If the images are not appearing, use this command instead:
(*you can also specify an IP if you are working on a remote server*)
```
DISCOURSE_HOSTNAME=localhost UNICORN_LISTENER=localhost:3000 bin/ember-cli -u
```

You should now be able to navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see your local Discourse installation.

## Create New Admin

To create a new admin, run the following command:

```
bin/rails admin:create
```

Follow the prompts, and a new admin account will be created. 

## Configure Mail

Run MailHog:

```
mailhog
```

Congratulations! You are now the admin of your own Discourse installation!

Happy hacking! And to get started with that, see [Beginner’s Guide to Creating Discourse Plugins](https://meta.discourse.org/t/beginners-guide-to-creating-discourse-plugins/30515).
