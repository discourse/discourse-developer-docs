Continuing from https://meta.discourse.org/t/future-social-authentication-improvements/94691...

We are now in the process of moving all 'associated account' information into a single database table. This will help to significantly reduce duplicated logic, and allow quicker development in the future. For example, [migrating our core twitter logic](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/160d29b18a0ff68f0cdc152b9d5f461869190b7e) to the new system reduced the number of lines of code from 136 to just 24 :tada:. 

This post isn't designed to be a step-by-step instruction manual for adding a new authentication provider, but it will aim to provide an overview, pointing to the relevant source code where necessary.

## Implementing an authenticator

Each authenticator **must** implement a subclass of [Auth::Authenticator](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/lib/auth/authenticator.rb). To use the new shared logic, the authenticator **can** instead extend [Auth::ManagedAuthenticator](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/lib/auth/managed_authenticator.rb). An example of a bare-bones implementation can be found in the core Facebook authenticator:

https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/lib/auth/facebook_authenticator.rb

`name`, `enabled?` and `register_middleware` must be overridden by implementing classes. 

> :information_source: **Aside:** for multisite compatibility, it is important that any site-specific information is supplied to omniauth in a `setup` lambda, rather than being fixed at the time of definition. See all core authenticators for examples of this.

All logic to link external accounts to Discourse accounts is handled by `Auth::ManagedAuthenticator`. This relies on the omniauth provider returning data in the format defined in [their documentation](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Auth-Hash-Schema). If any manipulation of this data is required, Authenticators can override the `after_authenticate` method, and manipulate the auth_token as required. For example, the core Twitter authenticator removes all the `extra` information from the token:

https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/b46b6e72d1906ca31e29855bda71f3498c8e203f/lib/auth/twitter_authenticator.rb#L10-L14

Data is stored in the `user_associated_accounts` database table. `provider_uid`, `info`, `credentials` and `extra` are all taken directly from the data returned by omniauth.

https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/b46b6e72d1906ca31e29855bda71f3498c8e203f/app/models/user_associated_account.rb#L13-L24

Once an `Authenticator` class has been defined, it needs to be registered. This must happen early in the application's lifecycle, and can **not** happen within a plugin's `after_initialize` method. The minimum registration can simply contain a reference to the authenticator. In a plugin, registration can be done using the `auth_provider` function. For example:

```ruby
auth_provider authenticator: OpenIDConnectAuthenticator.new()
```
In core, registration takes place in [`discourse.rb`](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/b46b6e72d1906ca31e29855bda71f3498c8e203f/lib/discourse.rb#L215-L222). A full list of possible `AuthProvider` options can be found [here](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/lib/auth/auth_provider.rb#L8-L12). Text content **can** be defined using these options, but it is better to provide localisable strings in `client.en.yml` following the standard keys. For example:

https://github.com/discourse/discourse-openid-connect/blob/88fdf7b5ab624aba7c207e403665e0393334794a/config/locales/client.en.yml#L1-L7

[details=Additional ManagedAuthenticator notes by @fantasticfears]
## `ManagedAuthenticator` in details

You might need to work on something special for authentication. And you would like to know more about `ManagedAuthenticator`. Basically, it has several operations, options, and controls how the data will be used.

Discourse manages user information with two controllers. `Users::OmniauthCallbacksController` manages the payload once OAuth2 authentication is done. `after_authenticate` is called here. `can_connect_existing_user?` is also used here.
There are some private methods you can read to understand how different data fields work.

```ruby
if authenticator.can_connect_existing_user? && current_user
  @auth_result = authenticator.after_authenticate(auth, existing_account: current_user)
else
  @auth_result = authenticator.after_authenticate(auth)
end
```

`UsersController` has `revoke_account` which uses `can_revoke?` and `revoke`. But for the `revoke` method to work remotely, you need to build your own implementation.

`UserAuthenticator` is a service class helping authenticate (verifying email confirmation or OAuth2 path) users. `after_create_account` is called here.

The core logic remains at `after_authenticate` with `Auth::Result` data class. We follow data structure here. `extra_data` will be passed to `after_create_account` for creating related records.

```ruby
result.extra_data = {
  provider: auth_token[:provider],
  uid: auth_token[:uid],
  info: auth_token[:info],
  extra: auth_token[:extra],
  credentials: auth_token[:credentials]
}
```

It will try to match and connects to an existing account.

You might wonder why automatic account creation is possible but there is no `User.create`. This is done in `UsersController#create`. 

```ruby
authentication = UserAuthenticator.new(user, session)
```

The user is a fresh instance will be populated by session data which is prepared by the auth provider. Trust me, it's just magic.

### Migration to the new system

To provide a seamless switch to the new system, data should be migrated from the old storage location. For core authentication providers, this may be dedicated tables. For plugins, this may be `plugin_store_rows`, or `oauth2_user_infos`. The minimum data required in a `user_associated_accounts` row is `provider_name`, `provider_uid` and `user_id`. For an example migration see:

https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/db/migrate/20181207141900_migrate_twitter_user_info.rb

Once the `ManagedAuthenticator` system has been released to the stable branch with v2.2.0, we will begin migrating official authentication **plugins**. At this point, a `plugin_store_row` migration example will be added here.
