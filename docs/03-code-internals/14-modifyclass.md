For advanced themes and plugins, Discourse offers the `modifyClass` system. This allows you to extend and override functionality in many of core's javascript classes.

## When to use `modifyClass`

`modifyClass` should be a last resort, when your customization cannot be made via Discourse's more stable customization APIs (e.g. plugin-api methods, plugin outlets, transformers).

Core's code can change at any time. And therefore, customizations made via `modifyClass` could break at any time. When using this API, you should ensure that you have controls in place to catch those issues before they reach a production site. For example, you could add automated tests to the theme/plugin, or you could use a staging site to test incoming Discourse updates against your theme/plugin.

## Basic Usage

`api.modifyClass` can be used to modify the functions and properties of any class which is accessible via the Ember resolver. That includes Discourse's routes, controllers, services and components.

`modifyClass` takes two arguments:

- `resolverName` (string) - construct this by using the type (e.g. component/controller/etc.), followed by a colon, followed by the (dasherized) filename name of the class. For example: `component:d-button`, `component:modal/login`, `controller:user`, `route:application`, etc.

- `callback` (function) - a function which receives the existing class definition, and then returns an extended version.

For example, to modify the `click()` action on d-button:
   
```js
api.modifyClass(
  "component:d-button",
  (Superclass) =>
    class extends Superclass {
      @action
      click() {
        console.log("button was clicked");
        super.click();
      }
    }
);
```

The `class extends ...` syntax mimics that of [JS child classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#inheritance). In general, any syntax/features supported by child classes can be applied here. That includes `super`, static properties/functions, and more.

However, there are some limitations. The `modifyClass` system only detects changes to the class's JS `prototype`. Practically, that means:

- introducing or modifying a `constructor()` is not supported

  ```js
  api.modifyClass("component:foo", (Superclass) => class extends Superclass {
    constructor() {
      // This is not supported. The constructor will be ignored
    }
  });
  ```

- introducing or modifying class fields is not supported (although some decorated class fields, like `@tracked` can be used)

  ```js
  api.modifyClass("component:foo", (Superclass) => class extends Superclass {
    someField = "foo"; // NOT SUPPORTED - do not copy
    @tracked someOtherField = "foo"; // This is ok
  });
  ```

- simple class fields on the original implementation cannot be overridden in any way (although, as above, `@tracked` fields can be overridden by another `@tracked` field)

  ```js
  // Core code:
  class Foo extends Component {
    // This core field cannot be overridden
    someField = "original"; 

    // This core tracked field can be overridden by including
    // `@tracked someTrackedField = ` in the modifyClass call
    @tracked someTrackedField = "original";
  }
  ```

If you find yourself wanting to do these things, then your use-case may be better satisfied by making a PR to introduce new APIs in core (e.g. plugin outlets, transformers, or bespoke APIs).

## Upgrading Legacy Syntax

In the past, modifyClass was called using an object-literal syntax like this:

```js
// Outdated syntax - do not use
api.modifyClass("component:some-component", {
  someFunction() {
    const original = this._super();
    return original + " some change";
  }
  pluginId: "some-unique-id"
});
```

This syntax is no longer recommended, and has known bugs (e.g. overriding getters or `@actions`). Any code using this syntax should be updated to use the native-class syntax described above. In general, conversion can be done by:

1. removing `pluginId` - this is no longer required
2. Update to the modern native-class syntax described above
3. Test your changes

## Troubleshooting

### Class already initialized

When using modifyClass in an initializer, you may see this warning in the console:

> `Attempted to modify "{name}", but it was already initialized earlier in the boot process`

In theme/plugin development, there are two ways this error is normally introduced:

- **Adding a `lookup()` caused the error**
  
  If you `lookup()` a singleton too early in the boot process, it will cause any later `modifyClass` calls to fail. In this situation, you should try to move the lookup to happen later. For example, you would change something like this:

  ```js
  // Lookup service in initializer, then use it at runtime (bad!)
  export default apiInitializer("0.8", (api) => {
    const composerService = api.container.lookup("service:composer");
    api.composerBeforeSave(async () => {
      composerService.doSomething();
    });
  });
  ```


  To this:

  ```js
  // 'Just in time' lookup of service (good!)
  export default apiInitializer("0.8", (api) => {
    api.composerBeforeSave(async () => {
      const composerService = api.container.lookup("service:composer");
      composerService.doSomething();
    });
  });
  ```

- **Adding a new `modifyClass` caused the error**

  If the error is introduced by your theme/plugin adding a `modifyClass` call, then you'll need to move it earlier in the boot process. This commonly happens when overriding methods on services (e.g. topicTrackingState), and on models which are initialized early in the app boot process (e.g. a `model:user` is initialized for `service:current-user`).

  Moving the modifyClass call earlier in the boot process normally means moving the call to a `pre-initializer`, and configuring it to run before Discourse's 'inject-discourse-objects' initializer. For example:

  ```js
  // (plugin)/assets/javascripts/discourse/pre-initializers/extend-user-for-my-plugin.js
  // or
  // (theme)/javascripts/discourse/pre-initializers/extend-user-for-my-plugin.js

  import { withPluginApi } from "discourse/lib/plugin-api";

  export default {
    name: "extend-user-for-my-plugin",
    before: "inject-discourse-objects",

    initializeWithApi(api) {
      api.modifyClass("model:user", {
        myNewUserFunction() {
          return "hello world";
        }
      });
    },

    initialize() {
      withPluginApi("0.12.1", this.initializeWithApi);
    },
  };
  ```

  This modification of the user model should now work without printing a warning, and the new method will be available on the currentUser object.
